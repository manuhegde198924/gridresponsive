about steps in project:
The CSS grid layout module is used to create a grid-based layout system, with the help of rows and columns it makes it easier to design any webpage without using floats and positioning.

Syntax:

.class {
    display:grid;
}

Note: An HTML element becomes a grid if that element sets display: grid; in style section or inline-grid. Below you will see both examples.

CSS Grid Layout Properties: These are the following grid-layout properties:

    column-gap: It is used to specify the amount of gap between the columns in which a given text is divided using the column-count property.
    gap: It is used to set the spacing also caller gutter between the rows and columns.
    grid: It offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without floats and positioning.
    grid-area: It is used to set a grid item size and location in a grid layout.
    grid-auto-columns: It is used to specify the size for the columns of implicitly generated grid containers.
    grid-auto-flow: It specifies exactly how auto-placed items get flow into the grid.
    grid-auto-rows: It is used to specify the size for the rows of implicitly generated grid containers.
    grid-column: It describes the number of properties that allow to design of grid structures and control the placement of grid items using CSS.
    grid-column-end: It explains the number of columns an item will span, or on which column-line the item will end.
    grid-column-gap: It is used to set the size of the gap between the columns in a grid layout.
    grid-column-start: It defines for which column line item will start.
    grid-gap: It is used to sets the size of the gap between the rows and columns in a grid layout.
    grid-row: It is used to specify the size and location in a grid layout.
    grid-row-end: It is used to define the grid item’s end position within a grid row by specifying the inline edge of its grid area.
    grid-row-gap: It is used to define the size of the gap between the grid elements.
    grid-row-start: It is used to define the grid items’ start position within the grid row by specifying the inline start edge of its grid area.
    grid-template: It is a shorthand property for defining grid columns, rows, and areas.
    grid-template-areas: It is used to specify the area within the grid layout.
    grid-template-columns: It is used to set the number of columns and size of the columns of the grid.
    grid-template-rows: It is used to set the number of rows and height of the rows in a grid.
    ou can control the following things on a grid system:

    grid-column-gap
    grid-row-gap
    grid-gap
    You can control the following things on a grid system:

    grid-column-lines
    grid-row-lines
    Uniqueness In Grid And Flexbox:

One Vs Two Dimensions:

    Grid is made for a two-dimensional layout while Flexbox is for one. This means Flexbox can work on either row or columns at a time, but Grids can work on both.
    Flexbox gives you more flexibility while working on either element (row or column). HTML markup and CSS will be easy to manage in this type of scenario.
    GRID gives you more flexibility to move around the blocks irrespective of your HTML markup.

Content-First vs Layout-First:

    The major Uniqueness between Flexbox and Grids is that the former works on content while the latter is based on the layout.
    The Flexbox layout is best suited to application components and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is designed for larger-scale layouts that are not linear in design.

Difference Between Grid and Flexbox:

1. Dimensionality and Flexibility:

    Flexbox offers greater control over alignment and space distribution between items. Being one-dimensional, Flexbox only deals with either columns or rows.
    Grid has two-dimension layout capabilities which allow flexible widths as a unit of length. This compensates for the limitations in Flex.

2. Alignment:

    Flex Direction allows developers to align elements vertically or horizontally, which is used when developers create and reverse rows or columns.
    CSS Grid deploys fractional measure units for grid fluidity and auto-keyword functionality to automatically adjust columns or rows.

3. Item Management

    Flex Container is the parent element while Flex Item represents the children. The Flex Container can ensure balanced representation by adjusting item dimensions. This allows developers to design for fluctuating screen sizes.
    Grid supports both implicit and explicit content placement. Its inbuilt automation allows it to automatically extend line items and copy values into the new creation from the preceding item.

Conclusion

    CSS Grids helps you create the outer layout of the webpage. You can build complex as well responsive design with this. This is why it is called ‘layout first’.
    Flexbox mostly helps align content & move blocks.
    CSS grids are for 2D layouts. It works with both rows and columns.
    Flexbox works better in one dimension only (either rows OR columns).
    It will be more time-saving and helpful if you use both at the same time
